    	<p>I was thinking about doing a clean install after upgrading to Mountain Lion, so I took the opportunity to go through my app folder and see what I really needed. In the process I put together this list of essential applications.</p>

<h3>Web browsers</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/no/chrome/browser/?hl=no">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></strong></p>

<p>Since I do a bit off web developing I need to test my website in all the mayor browsers. Google Chrome is my default browser and I absolutely love the way it syncs all my bookmarks etc. over all my devices that run Google Chrome.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mail/">Mail.app</a></h3>

<p>I use the default Mail app that comes with Mac OS X. I am not a hardcore email user, so Mail.app does all I need.</p>

<h3><a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">nvALT</a></h3>

<p>I like to take notes, and for that I use nvALT. nvALT is a  <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> fork that adds support for Markdown and other handy stuff. It syncs with Simplenote and Dropbox so I can keep editing my notes while on the go with my iPhone.</p>

<h3><a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a></h3>

<p>I have been a Spotify user for several years, and I'm really happy about it.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a></h3>

<p>I have just started using Sublime Text 2 as my default editor instead off <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>. I don't know if it will be my default editor for a long time, or if I will go back to <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> again. Before I started using <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="http://panic.com/coda">Coda</a> was my default editor/IDE.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a></h3>

<p>iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It does many things that the default Terminal don't do.</p>

<h3><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a></h3>

<p>CodeKit helps you build websites faster and better. It process Less, Sass, Stylus, Jade, Haml, CoffeeScript, Javascript and Compass files automatically and instantly reloads your browser.</p>

<p>If you are a web developer and don't want the hassle with the command line, then you should really get this application.</p>

<h3><a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a></h3>

<p>Skype is a at the moment my default IM alongside with Facebook chat. It's not perfect, but it does what it does okay.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim">MacVim</a></h3>

<p>Although Sublime Text 2 is my default editor and I love TextMate, I still like to use vim on a occasion.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a></h3>

<p>Alfred is a application launcher and a quick way to different types of files, and also at the same time so much more! You can extend it with the <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">Powerpack</a> to make it do all types of things, like browse and play music from your iTunes library quickly or find and control all your files. If you want to increase your productivity, you really should get your hands on <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.git-tower.com/">Tower</a></h3>

<p>I mostly use git from the command line, but sometimes it is handy to have a GUI to control it from. And for that, Tower is probably the most efficient and powerful to use.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraphsketcher/">OmniGraphSketcher</a></h3>

<p>OmniGraphSketcher is a elegant way to make precise graphs to use for reports, presentations and other things where you need to produce good-looking graphs on the fly. It lets you easily import data from anywhere - Excel, for example - via copy and paste.</p>

<p>When you're done with you're graph, you can easily export it to PDF, PNG, JPEG and EPS.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/productID.237192800?WT.mc_id=mercent&amp;siteID=g1Lsixx0VQU-cTqNGY5O82_ozcEIIe_e4w&amp;mr:referralID=a8c1beb7-ff2f-11e1-8751-001b2166c2c0">Microsoft Office</a></h3>

<p>Still the standard by which all other Office-style applications are measured, the new Office 2011 for Mac is easy to use and retains all the power functionality of Office 2010 for Windows. I do not use it as often, but I do use it for all school related work, and it's always handy to have around.</p>

<h3><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a></h3>

<p>If you regularly find yourself typing the same piece of text over and over again, TextExpander can save you much time, turning your custom abbreviations into full text and images.</p>

<p>I use TextExpander everyday and it comes in handy all the time. If you write much in Markdown, make sure you check out <a href="http://bettermess.com/lazymarkdown/">this post</a> from <a href="http://bettermess.com/">Michael Schechter</a> for some really good TextExpander snippets.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a></h3>

<p>Hazel is your personal housekeeper. Hazel watches whatever folders you tell it to, and automatically organizing your files according to the rules you create. Hazel can also open, archive, set color labels, add Spotlight comments, import your files into iPhoto or iTunes, and much more. Make sure to check out their website for information about all it can do.</p>

<h3><a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-for-mac-beta-sort-of">Tweetbot</a></h3>

<p>I absolutely love Tweetbot on iOS, and while Tweetbot for Mac is just in beta, it's already my default <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> client. It's currently in version 0.8 but has already most off features you would want from a full-featured Twitter client.</p>

<h3><a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a></h3>

<p>I think everyone knows what Dropbox is, and if you don't, check it out immediately!</p>

<h3><a href="http://mplayerx.org/">MPlayerX</a></h3>

<p>QuickTime is beautiful, but it doesn't support many file formats. That's where MPlayerX comes in! MPlayerX is an media player that support almost every format you would throw at it. MPlayerX can also be controlled by <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC377LL/A">Apple Remote</a>.</p>
