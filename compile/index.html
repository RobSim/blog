      	<blockquote><p>We launched Google Reader in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with Google Takeout over the course of the next four months.</p></blockquote>

<p>This means that we will all have to find a new way to sync our feeds across out different feed reader applications. This might sound bad, but I am <em>sure</em> there will come new, and much better services soon enough.</p>

      	<blockquote><p>Today Dropbox announced upgrades to its desktop client to allow for quick sharing of files with others, and improved updates that will help users keep up with the service. The most significant update involves an easier way to share files with a link – not a new capability – directly from the Dropbox desktop menu, which cuts down on the steps needed to send content to others.</p>

<p>In keeping with that change, the Dropbox menu has been improved to also accept files more simply, with access to shared files – in the new link form – in the menu itself. The notifications will be sent out in real-time, according to the firm.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is great to see Dropbox getting a update to easier share with others.</p>

      	<p>I think the main reason that Facebook isn't as fun as it used to be, is because almost everyone have a Facebook account. Social networks tends to be more cooler when the audience off the social network is more private or locked-down, like before when Instagram was only available for iPhone.</p>

Even casual users themselves perpetuate it: «Oh, I’m not doing much on my computer, so I always just go with the cheapest option.» And then they buy a horrid, underpowered netbook, find out that it has a tiny screen, is incredibly slow, the keyboard sucks, and they either never actually use it, or eventually come to the conclusion that they just hate computers.</p>

<p>In reality, it’s exactly backwards: proficient users can deal with a crappy computer, but casual users need as good a computer as possible.</p></blockquote>

      	<p>As of today, Apple's failed music-focused social network, Ping, is officially closed.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are a lot of reasons why Ping failed, the biggest of which was probably the lack of Facebook integration when the service launched. Back in 2010, the word was that Apple was <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/02/all-things-d-facebook-blocked-apples-ping-service-for-unauthor/">forced to pull Facebook</a> from the service at the last minute, leaving the service handicapped. Without the backing of the world's biggest social network, the service never achieved critical mass — in fact, the only positive mention of Ping that we can find came right after launch, when Apple bragged of <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/03Ping-Users-Top-One-Million-in-First-48-Hours.html">one million sign-ups</a> in 24 hours.</p></blockquote>

				<a href="/2012/09/15/essential-mac-applications" class="permalink" title="Permalink">Permalink</a>
				
		</header>

      	<p>I was thinking about doing a clean install after upgrading to Mountain Lion, so I took the opportunity to go through my app folder and see what I really needed. In the process I put together this list of essential applications.</p>

<h3>Web browsers</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/no/chrome/browser/?hl=no">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></strong></p>

<p>Since I do a bit off web developing I need to test my website in all the mayor browsers. Google Chrome is my default browser and I absolutely love the way it syncs all my bookmarks etc. over all my devices that run Google Chrome.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mail/">Mail.app</a></h3>

<p>I use the default Mail app that comes with Mac OS X. I am not a hardcore email user, so Mail.app does all I need.</p>

<h3><a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">nvALT</a></h3>

<p>I like to take notes, and for that I use nvALT. nvALT is a  <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> fork that adds support for Markdown and other handy stuff. It syncs with Simplenote and Dropbox so I can keep editing my notes while on the go with my iPhone.</p>

<h3><a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a></h3>

<p>I have been a Spotify user for several years, and I'm really happy about it.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a></h3>

<p>I have just started using Sublime Text 2 as my default editor instead off <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>. I don't know if it will be my default editor for a long time, or if I will go back to <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> again. Before I started using <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="http://panic.com/coda">Coda</a> was my default editor/IDE.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a></h3>

<p>iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It does many things that the default Terminal don't do.</p>

<h3><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a></h3>

<p>CodeKit helps you build websites faster and better. It process Less, Sass, Stylus, Jade, Haml, CoffeeScript, Javascript and Compass files automatically and instantly reloads your browser.</p>

<p>If you are a web developer and don't want the hassle with the command line, then you should really get this application.</p>

<h3><a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a></h3>

<p>Skype is a at the moment my default IM alongside with Facebook chat. It's not perfect, but it does what it does okay.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim">MacVim</a></h3>

<p>Although Sublime Text 2 is my default editor and I love TextMate, I still like to use vim on a occasion.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a></h3>

<p>Alfred is a application launcher and a quick way to different types of files, and also at the same time so much more! You can extend it with the <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">Powerpack</a> to make it do all types of things, like browse and play music from your iTunes library quickly or find and control all your files. If you want to increase your productivity, you really should get your hands on <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.git-tower.com/">Tower</a></h3>

<p>I mostly use git from the command line, but sometimes it is handy to have a GUI to control it from. And for that, Tower is probably the most efficient and powerful to use.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraphsketcher/">OmniGraphSketcher</a></h3>

<p>OmniGraphSketcher is a elegant way to make precise graphs to use for reports, presentations and other things where you need to produce good-looking graphs on the fly. It lets you easily import data from anywhere - Excel, for example - via copy and paste.</p>

<p>When you're done with you're graph, you can easily export it to PDF, PNG, JPEG and EPS.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/productID.237192800?WT.mc_id=mercent&amp;siteID=g1Lsixx0VQU-cTqNGY5O82_ozcEIIe_e4w&amp;mr:referralID=a8c1beb7-ff2f-11e1-8751-001b2166c2c0">Microsoft Office</a></h3>

<p>Still the standard by which all other Office-style applications are measured, the new Office 2011 for Mac is easy to use and retains all the power functionality of Office 2010 for Windows. I do not use it as often, but I do use it for all school related work, and it's always handy to have around.</p>

<h3><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a></h3>

<p>If you regularly find yourself typing the same piece of text over and over again, TextExpander can save you much time, turning your custom abbreviations into full text and images.</p>

<p>I use TextExpander everyday and it comes in handy all the time. If you write much in Markdown, make sure you check out <a href="http://bettermess.com/lazymarkdown/">this post</a> from <a href="http://bettermess.com/">Michael Schechter</a> for some really good TextExpander snippets.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a></h3>

<p>Hazel is your personal housekeeper. Hazel watches whatever folders you tell it to, and automatically organizing your files according to the rules you create. Hazel can also open, archive, set color labels, add Spotlight comments, import your files into iPhoto or iTunes, and much more. Make sure to check out their website for information about all it can do.</p>

<h3><a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-for-mac-beta-sort-of">Tweetbot</a></h3>

<p>I absolutely love Tweetbot on iOS, and while Tweetbot for Mac is just in beta, it's already my default <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> client. It's currently in version 0.8 but has already most off features you would want from a full-featured Twitter client.</p>

<h3><a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a></h3>

<p>I think everyone knows what Dropbox is, and if you don't, check it out immediately!</p>

<h3><a href="http://mplayerx.org/">MPlayerX</a></h3>

<p>QuickTime is beautiful, but it doesn't support many file formats. That's where MPlayerX comes in! MPlayerX is an media player that support almost every format you would throw at it. MPlayerX can also be controlled by <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC377LL/A">Apple Remote</a>.</p>

      	<h3>Using Pandoc</h3>

<p>Converting a Markdown file to a Word document with pandoc is really easy. All you need to do is to get <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> version 1.9 or higher, then:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh">pandoc myfile.txt -o myfile.docx
</code></pre></div>


<p>That will take the file myfile.txt and convert it to the Word document myfile.docx.</p>

<h3>Using Google Docs</h3>

<p>If you don't want to install pandoc for some reason, you can also use Google Docs. Convert your Markdown file to HTML, then upload it to Google Docs, select the option for Google Docs to convert it to their format, then download it as a DOC file.</p>

      	<p>First off all, if you don't know what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> is, it's a decentralized electronic cash system that uses peer-to-peer networking, digital signatures and cryptographic proof so as to enable users to conduct irreversible transactions without relying on trust.</p>

<h3>What is bitcoin mining?</h3>

<p>Bitcoin mining is the process of securing transactions and committing them into the bitcoin public chain. It requires winning a kind of computational lottery where each hash you perform is like buying one ticket. The Bitcoin protocol currently permits the miner who generates a block to claim 50 bitcoins as well as any transaction fees for the transactions that miner chooses to include.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin system uses the mining process to generate coins, secure transactions, and publish transactions.</p>

<h3>How do I get started?</h3>

<p><em>Note: You will need a good GPU to start with bitcoin mining, CPU mining is pretty useless. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison#Graphics_cards">Here is a comparison off good GPU's for bitcoin mining.</a></em></p>

<p>To start with bitcoin mining, you will need a bitcoin miner on your
computer and, of course, a bitcoin address (If you don't already have one, sign up for one at <a href="https://blockchain.info/wallet/">blockchain</a> - a safe and secure online bitcoin wallet).</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=3878.0">GUI Miner</a> as my bitcoin miner, so download it from the forum and run it. When you got your bitcoin miner up running, you will need to sign up for a bitcoin pool. I recommend <a href="http://deepbit.net">deepbit</a>, so <a href="https://deepbit.net/register.php">sign up here</a> and verify your email. Put your bitcoin adress into your <a href="https://deepbit.net/account">profile</a>, and then, in GUI Miner, choose deepbit as the server, put your email that you sign up with at deepbit in the email field, and fill out your password that you also signed up with in the password field, and start mining!</p>

      	<p>Just add the following line to /etc/sshd_config (on the machine you’re SSHing into):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh">ClientAliveInterval 60
</code></pre></div>


<p>Next time you SSH of SFTP you’ll be sending ‘keepalive’ packets every 60 seconds.</p>

      	<p>So, I've just finished up setting up this brand new blog. Before I've always run a WordPress blog, but since WordPress is kind of over-kill with all it features that I don't need, I've decided to try something new, so this time I am running a static blog with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p></blockquote>

<p>So after I started using jekyll, I don't need any database server, because everything is stored in static files. It also means I can use whatever editor I want to use (TextMate or vim) to write my blog posts in markdown.</p>

<p>So if I want to publish a new post, I simply do:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh">rake post <span class="nv">title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Super awesome post&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>That will generate a new markdown file, which I then just edit with my desired editor and then do:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh">git add .
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Added new content&quot;</span>
git push origin master
</code></pre></div>


<p>And that will push my new post over to my server and it will be live on the internet.</p>

<p>I love this solution, it's so simple and it super lightweight, since all the web server will need do is just serving some static files, and not generating dynamic content in some scripting language and fetching content from a database server, like it would do if I used something like WordPress.</p>

<p>If you want make your own blog like this, make sure to checkout <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll-Bootstap</a>.</p>
