We live inside of a computer simulation. We are created by a merging of our parents source code. We are not who we think we are. We are not what we think we are. We are not where we think we are.

The Matrix. It really is an interesting concept. I'm quite curious as to why people *don't* believe we live inside a computer program. Is living inside computer program less plausible than god's existence? The answer is probably not, yet [90.34%](http://im.robs.im/Z140hP) of the world still believes in some form of god. Let's take a second to view a conversation I overheard between god and a computer simulation.

God: I explain everything that physics can't.

Simulation: So can I.

God: I explain how the first humans were created.

Simulation: So can I.

God: I explain where people go when they die.

Simulation: So can I.

God: I can make miracles happen.

Simulation: So can I.

I can go on like this forever. If you don't believe me, send me and email at (youmustbefriendswithgod@thepearlygates.com). 

Now you might be mad because I claimed god doesn't exist. Well actually I didn't, but that's not the point. The point is that living in a Matrix-like world is just as plausible as god's existence, yet almost nobody believes we live in The Matrix. Is that because technology such as computer simulation is so new compared to god, or is it because of something else? I really don't know the answer. 

Our ancestors started thinking about god in about [25,000 BCE](http://im.robs.im/ViOO2G), give or take 5 thousand years. The first programmable computer was created in 1936. For every year the computer has been around, religion has survived for 350 years. Maybe in 25000 years we'll all believe in the Matrix.
