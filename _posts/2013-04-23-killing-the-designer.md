Design is changing drastically. There are so many amazing things happening in the industry right now, but, like most of today's news, this post is going to be focusing on one sad aspect. The growing popularity of so called "Design Contests" and the companies that promote them. There are too many problems to count, but I'm going to focus on the most important ones. 

The first, and most obvious problem is that entering design contests is not a sustainable business model. When you're battling against hundreds of submissions, spending a few hours is not an option. It all has to do with the choice of the client, compensation is not guaranteed, and the client probably is getting a product that has been used before, in some form or another.

This brings me to the second point. Designing for a client can't be done in one email. When a client uses design contests to get what they need, chances are they're not getting a unique design, and it's not beneficial for either party. I spend more time on Skype or in a Google Hangout with a client, before even opening [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) or [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html) than most of the people on 99Designs spend per design. How do you expect to get the solution you need when the designer only knows what you wrote in 300 words on your design contest listing?

If you're a designer, I'd urge you to stop using 99Designs to make a quick buck, and have some self respect. Read [Design is a Job](http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job), it's honestly the best $9 you'll spend this month. Don't sell yourself short.

If you're a client, or someone who hires designers, do yourself and this industry a favour and hire a professional designer. You will get a better end experience, and you'll be supporting the industry.

Compare it to another industry. You don't go out and ask a hundred bakers to each bake you a wedding cake, so you can pick one, so why is it okay to do this with designers?
