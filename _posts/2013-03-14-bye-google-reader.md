>We launched Google Reader in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with Google Takeout over the course of the next four months.

This means that we will all have to find a new way to sync our feeds across out different feed reader applications. This might sound bad, but I am *sure* there will come new, and much better services soon enough.
