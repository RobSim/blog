[Rise](http://im.robs.im/10Qtdkd) by [SimpleBots](http://www.simplebots.co) is my new go-to alarm clock app. It even has it's very own place of pride on my home screen. It's an extremely simple app that's almost entirely controlled with gestures. It has a beautiful UI, and it works *all* the time. I think that last point is key for an alarm clock application, but surprisingly enough, I've tried a couple of other apps that've crashed and not woken me up. They now sit in the iTunes graveyard of the "Not on This iPhone" tab in Purchases.

When you first launch the app, they have a nice little interactive tutorial that'll show you everything you need to know about Rise in about 45 seconds. Then, all you see is a beautiful gradient and the wake up time displayed on the screen, as well as a tiny settings icon an a little clock with the current time displayed on it. To change the wake up time, just drag your finger to the time you'd like. Tap on either above or below the wake up time to fine tune it. Swipe to one side or the other to turn it on an you're good to go!

I have *almost* nothing but praise for Rise. It's perfect in just about every way. It's simple, intuitive, gesture based and beautiful to look at. You can use your own songs as a wake up sound, or use one of there surprisingly nice tones that they include by default. The "Dance Club Dream" tone works surprisingly well to motivate you to get out of bed, funny as the name sounds. It has the option of progressively upping the volume on the tone of your choice, which is a great touch. It also has a repeat button, which is where my only minor complaint comes from. You can set it to repeat every day, or not at all, but there is no option for every weekday, or anything of the sort. Now I completely understand why they don't have it, because it would require a whole new menu, but as a student, I only really have to wake up at a specified time on workdays. 

Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a simpler way to wake up, and with the gesture based UI, the slight annoyance of not being able to set a custom repeat schedule is greatly outweighed by the overall classiness of Rise. 

EDIT: The new updates with the sleep timer for music and all the other little tweaks make it perfect. Get it now.
