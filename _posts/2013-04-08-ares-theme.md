You should know this already, but I love [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com). When I use other Macs, I constantly hit command + space, waiting for Alfred to pop up. Don't even get me started on Windows. One of my favourite things about Alfred is themes, and I've made my own which I thought I'd share with you.

The theme is called Ares. I have no idea why it's called that, but it's a super minimal theme. Download it [here](http://cl.ly/36431j3M1F0I/download/Ares.alfredappearance).
