How long would it take the average single male Foxconn employee to save enough money to buy an iPad

Foxconn workers make on average *about* **$17** per day, and they work 6 days a week. 

365.242(days in a year)/12(months)=30.436833333(days per month)/7(days a week)*6(working days)=
**26.088714288** working days/month.

Approximately 26 working days a month, the average Foxconn worker would make **$442** a month. (Based in Shanghai, China)

Basic living expenses for a single male with no health problems and no insurance as **$382.50** per month to live inside the factory. (Shanghai)

He would have **$59.5** left per month.

An iPad in Shanghai costs **3688RMB** or **$592.67** USD.

It would take our typical Foxconn employee just under **10 months **(9.960840336) or just under **260 working days** (259.865517571) to be able to buy an Retina iPad.

An iPhone 5 costs **5288RBM** or **$849.79** USD. It would take over **14 months** (14.282184874) to save enough to buy an iPhone 5.
