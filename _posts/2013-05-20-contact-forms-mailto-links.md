TL;DR: Probably use both.

The contact forms vs mailto links debate has been going on for a while, and there is no clear winner, but, without knowing your particular usage scenario, I recommend using both. They both have their pros and cons, so I'll go over both in detail in the following paragraphs.

Contact Forms are great, and I personally use them. The first reason to use them is to prevent spam coming to your email address. The second reason for contact forms is that contact forms can be analyzed and tracked, giving you more insight on how your users interact with your site. The third reason, and maybe one of the most important, is that contact forms work right there on your webpage, without forcing the user to use another program which may or may not be configured. Also, many people are now using web based mail services.

Contact forms also have their negatives, one of which is the fact that (generally) the user has more fields to enter. Even a simple form with just name, email and message is more than the subject and message of a native client. The second big negative is the possibility for user error, especially typing their own email into the form incorrectly. This can end a possible sale before it has even began, and happens far to often. The third negative is the time and effort it takes to create and maintain a contact form, as well as the money it can cost.*

With mailto links, all you have to do is type up a little bit of html and you're set. No fancy CSS styling, no making sure it works, no testing to see if the link is responsive, just set and go. Mailto links are very reliable, and if your potential customers use email a lot, or you're targeting corporate clients, it's almost certain that they have desktop based mail set up, and they're comfortable using it. Also, people seem to trust email more than contact forms.

Mailto links also have their negatives, first and foremost being spam. Second, depending on your user base, some won't have a native client set up. Third, they require interaction with a separate program, taking your user away from your page and into something else. Fourth, depending on the user, mailto links can behave in unexpected and weird ways.

For most applications, I recommend using both a mailto link and a contact form, however for my personal site I use just a contact form. On most commercial products, letting users choose direct email is as simple as adding a line of text after your contact form saying something like "If you prefer, shoot us an email instead at company@company.com" People like to pick their poison. 

I just use a contact form on my site because as a designer and front end developer, it gives me a chance to [showcase my talents](http://robs.im#contact), with fancy CSS, effects and animation, and the great folks at [JotForm](http://www.jotform.com/) have been 100% reliable in my (unofficial) tests. You can take a look at [my site](http://robs.im) and [the contact form](http://robs.im#contact) on it for inspiration if you'd like. My reason for no mailto links is because (with quite a bit of work) the negatives of a form can be almost completely covered.
