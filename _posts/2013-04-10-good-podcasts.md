title: Why are good Podcasts so hard to find?

Why is it so hard to find good podcasts? I've spent hours looking for good podcasts on Web Design and Development, and I haven't found a single podcast that I'd subscribe to that way. Before giving up, I asked some friends in the industry, and right away I got 3 podcasts that I now listen to all the time. There is no doubt in my mind that there are good podcasts out there, but I find them very difficult to find. 

You can find almost anything on Google, but in my fruitless search, I saw the bad side of the web. Not just useless websites, which they all were, but websites that used Comic Sans for the body text for spam filled articles. To be fair, I didn't stay long enough to verify that it was in fact Comic Sans, but either way, it made me physically ill. So why is there no Podcast discovery service? There are too many discovery services to count for music, movies, books, apps, articles, you name it. [Last.fm](http://last.fm), [IMDB](http://imdb.com), [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com), [Appstorm](http://appstorm.net) and [Prismatic](http://blog.robs.im/2013/01/26/Prismatic/) are just a few of the aforementioned services. 

The world needs a Podcast Discovery Service. There are a bunch of great TLD's available for something like this, such as [thecast.io](http://instantname.me/?q=thecast.io) and [podster.io](http://instantname.me/?q=podster.io) (Go [Skywalker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpGoY56lakU) Go). It shouldn't be super difficult to implement in this day and age. There are so many startups with so many ideas, but here is something that I would use, and, more importantly for a startup, pay for. If someone does decide to make this, I'd be happy to give you more details on how I think such a service would/should work.

To close, and hopefully help out some other fruitless searchers, the podcasts I'm subscribed to right now are [The Industry Radio Show](http://theindustry.cc/live/), [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead) and [ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com/). If you have any other suggestions for me, please let me [know](mailto:me@robs.im).
